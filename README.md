Keepr

Description:
Keepr is a full stack application that is similar to Pinterest. Users can create Keeps (pins) and add them to Vaults (boards). A Keep includes a name, an image and a short description.
Users can create Vaults to store collection of similar keeps, either keeps that they have made or that other users have made. If a user does not want other users to be able to view
their vault, they can mark it "private" upon creation.
